          Spencer focuses on how we can create a more playful, expressive, and
          communal internet by giving people the agency of expressive relations,
          open protocols and local-first applications. He does this through
          creating (tools|games|spaces) that push how we're allowed to dictate
          digital places and objects, making site-specific net art that question
          our assumptions of what websites are and who we are when we visit
          them, and writing about his findings and the emotional journey of this
          independent path.
